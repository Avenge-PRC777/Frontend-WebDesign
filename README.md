# Frontend-WebDesign
This repo contains codes for learning the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript and more for WebDesign

# Static Web Design
This part is concerned with basic Frontend design using HTML, CSS and Javascript. The approach is that we first design boxes/containers (even nested) and once that's done, we can put content easily inside.

## Container Handling
This part focuses on how to create multiple boxes, what is the default behaviour. The types of stacking, etc.
